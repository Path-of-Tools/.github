# üóíÔ∏èContributing Guidelines

## Contributing
We welcome community support with both pull requests and reporting bugs. Please don't hesitate to jump in. 

**Note:** _If you see an issue that you'd like to tackle, please make sure to comment under the issue and ask to be assigned to it. This is mainly so we don't have multiple people working on the same issue at the same time._

## New Developers
Check out the list of outstanding pull requests if there is something you might be interested in. Occasionally you might find issues tagged with `good-first-issue`. These are intended for contributors who are either new to the code base or are just getting started on their journey in programming. Usually easy to complete tasks will be tagged with `good-first-issue`.

## Issues
The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, features requests and submitting pull requests, but please respect the following restrictions:
- Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests. Our [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Path-of-Tools/discussions/) page can be used for that.
- Please do not open issues or pull requests regarding the code in any project using our tools, unless those issues are caused by our tools.
- Please follow the issue template when creating issues. 
  
**Note:** _Occasionally issues are opened that are unclear, or we cannot verify them. When the issue author has not responded to our questions for verification within 7 days then we will close the issue._

## Pull Requests
The only thing that we have to say for opening pull requests, is to make sure that the pull requests are never directly open to the `master` branch. 

All of our repositories contain both a `master` and `development-master` or `dev-master`. All PR's should be open on either `development-master` or `dev-master` whichever is the case for the repository you're working on.

## Tests
All commits that fix bugs or add features needs a test written for them. 

## Visual Changes
When making a visual change, please provide screenshots and/or screencasts of the proposed change. This will help us to understand the desired change easier.
