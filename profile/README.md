# Path of Tools

## About Path Of Tools
Path of Tools is all about the creation of tools for the game Path of Exile. This organization was meant to hold all my personal projects regarding Path of Exile, but decided to give open source a try so here we are.

We're currently still very early in development, so there is definately not much to offer, but I hope that in the future this Organization and all it's Repositories, will have quite an impact on the PoE community.
